## Bigram
- One character simply predicts the next one using a lookup table that is create from a training data. The lookup table is created by storing the count of how many times some character $C_1$ follows another charecter $C_2$.

- If you just consider 26 English alphabets, then we will store how many times a follows any one of the 26 alphabets including itself. So there will be total of $26 \times 26 = 676$ such countings.
