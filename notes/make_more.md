# Make More
This file contains the references that I have used to build make_more crate.

- First one is the Andrej Karpathy [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/PaCmpygFfXo?si=WEwmyXhc-E91yXOQ).
- Second since I ma using burn to build this model the main reference was [the burn book](https://burn.dev/burn-book). It is a good read to understand how this framework helps us as a building blocks for our model.
